        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Waakye is a popular Ghanaian dish made from a combination of rice and beans. It is cooked with a red sorghum leaf sheath, known as "waakye leaves", that gives it a burgundy color and served with multiple sides including: lamb stew, spaghetti, avocado, shito, kelewele, vegetable salad and fried fish.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of rice</li>
            <li>1 cup of black-eyed peas or cowpeas</li>
            <li>4-5 dried leaves of sorghum (or a few drops of food coloring)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Water</li>  
            <li>Optional: fried plantains, boiled eggs, or any protein of your choice for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pick stones and grits from the beans.</li>
            <li>Wash the beans and waakye leaves. Add into a pressure cooker.</li>
            <li>Pour in water up to the minimum level on the pot.</li>
            <li>Close the valve of the pressure cooker and leave until it reaches full pressure (when it starts to whistle). This should take no more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Oce it reaches full pressure, reduce the heat and leave for additional 10 minutes to cook the beans.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and allow to cool down naturally to depressurize. This should take around 20 mins. You can speed this up by running the top of the pot under a cold water tap for about 3 mins. Please note that I am referring to stove top pressure cooker here and not electric pressure cooker</li>
            <li>Once the pot is adequately cooled. Unlock the lid and check the beans, you want it to be tender already with a little bite so it can be cooked with the rice.</li>
            <li>Pour the beans with the cooking liquid and the waakye leaves into another pot. Wash the rice and pour into the pot too.</li>
            <li>Add more water if needed so there is enough to cook the rice. Add some salt and cover the pot.</li>
           <li>Allow rice to cook. Take out the waakye leaves and serve with your favorite side.</li>
        </ol>
